<h2> A versatile and powerful platform. </h2> 

<p class="about"> If you have chosen to purchase a used BMW 335i or 135i car that is in good shape overall, and care about going very fast, then you made a great decision! The main reason being is the engine that powers both of these cars, bmw's N54 engine. The engine was bmw's early attempts at forced induction motors (Turbochargers) and because of this, they overbuilt the internals of the engine so that it would never blow under high boost pressure. Due to this, many street racers and car enthusiasts in general have invested in these cars because of how much horsepower you can get from the motor with a few mods. </p> 

<p class="about"> The purpose of my website is to help people navigate the ever increasing world of performance, visual, and reliability mods for the N54 bmw platform. The mission is to only showcase the highest quality mods, for the best current purchase and install prices with links to buy them. Since there are so many mods out there for sale, I wanted to bring together the best ones all in one location. My hope is that I can help steer people in the right direction when taking their nice bmw from stock to mod, because there are mistakes to be made without guidance. </p>

<h2 id="performancelink"> Performance Mods</h2>

<p class="about"> While there are many performance enhancing mods out there for the bmw 335i and 135i cars, there are a small few that are recommended by the entire mod community. Below are the performance mods that will add the most amount of horsepower for a reasonable price. These performance mods also take priority because they require a lesser amount of "reliability mods" to make work optimally for your car. </p>

<p class="about"> The Catless Downpipes are from the company VRSF and provide a larger pipe in which to push more air through, thus creating more horsepower! The current best price is from their direct website <a href="https://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-3-stainless-steel-catless-downpipes-n54-07-10-bmw-335i-08-10-bmw-135i.html">here.</a> </p>

<p class="about"> The Intercooler is also from the company VRSF and it provides a greater ability to cool the air being drawn into the car. This is required for those that tune that car past its stock limits. Buy it <a href="https://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-7-front-mount-intercooler-fmic-kit-135i-335i-n54-e82-e90-e92.html"> here.</a> </p>


<p class="about"> The Chargepipe is also from the company VRSF and it provides a safe and reliable way to carry the turbo charged air coming into the engine. The stock chargepipe is plastic and will crack and break after tuning the car. Buy it <a href="https://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-chargepipe-upgrade-07-13-bmw-135i-335i-n54-n55.html"> here.</a> </p>

<h2 id="maintenancelink"> Maintenance Mods </h2>

  <p class="about"> When tuning a stock bmw 335i to full bolt on status, you are pushing far past the power level the engine and components were designed for. Due to this, parts that are considered "weak links" need to be upgraded. Luckily, there is an active market with a lot of reliabiity type mods to choose for your n54 powered bmw! The three most important maintenace mods are as follows: </p>
