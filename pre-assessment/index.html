    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas -->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The alt attribute is generally used for decribing a visual with words, such as an image or picture of something. This is so screen readers and other software can better describe the image to a user. Title attribute gives search engines relevant title information according to that webpage.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <p><dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>Black hot drink that wakes you up!</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>White cold drink</dd>
</dl></p>
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
    <p><a class="hoverlink"  href="http://www.google.com">My favorite website!</a> </p>
